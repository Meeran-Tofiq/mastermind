You are going to choose between being the code BREAKER or the code MAKER.
The code MAKER be prompted to make the code, and the code BREAKER will be 
prompted to make a guess. You can choose to local play multiplayer, with 
a friend, or if you are the BREAKER, against the computer.

The code consists of 4 numbers, and the numbers have to be between 1 and 6.

If a guess contains a correct number at the correct location, you will be
shown a ' â–  ', without telling you WHICH number. If a guess contains the 
correct number, but at the wrong location, you will be shown a ' o ', wit-
-hout telling you WHICH number\n\n\n"
