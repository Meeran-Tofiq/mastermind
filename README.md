# mastermind
This is a game of Matermind. It is written in Ruby.

Two players go against each other. Either local multiplayer, or a human vs the computer. Each of the players are assigned a role. The code MASTER has to make the code that the other player, the code BREAKER, has to guess. The code is made up of 4-digits, each between 1 and 6. And the BREAKER has 10 tries. Each try reveals wether the player got a number in the correct location by showing a ' â–  ', or a correct number but in the wrong location by showing an ' o '.

# Project Description
This project was made to demonstrate my OOP based skills, and my ability to problem solve and think algorithmically. 

# The Challenges
This project required a lot of planning beforehand to make the structure of the code as authntically OOP as possible. However, having learned from my previous projects, it was far easier this time to reach a well balanced and neat structure.

# How to Use
There is no install, just take the code and run it in any ruby compiler.
